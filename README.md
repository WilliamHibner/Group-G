Project Title:  Baseball Shift

Description:  Has the popularity of the “infield shift” impacted baseball?

Background:  The infield shift is a generic term used in baseball to describe a defensive realignment from the standard positions to blanket one side of the field or another. Used primarily against left-handed batters, it is designed to protect against base hits pulled hard into the gaps between the fielders on one side (Wikipedia).
